# transit-detection-rnn

This repository contains all code used for my thesis: <br>
"Detecting Exoplanet Transit Signals in Light Curves Using Recurrent Neural Networks"

Note: towards the deadline of my thesis (July), I will clean up and structure the code better,
add comments, and improve documentation on how to generate, for example, your own light curves.
